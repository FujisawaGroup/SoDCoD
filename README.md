SoDCoD (Cu/Zn <ins>S</ins>uper<ins>o</ins>xide <ins>D</ins>ismutase <ins>Co</ins>nformational <ins>D</ins>iversity database)  
This database contains information on the properties of 188 types of SOD1 mutants, including structural changes and binding to Derlin-1, as well as a set of genes that contribute to the proteostasis of mutant-like wild-type SOD1.


## Files 
1. data_MSIP_CT4interaction.txt  
We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 188 SOD1 mutants concerning their structural alterations and interaction with Derlin-1.  
This file contains information on the properties of 188 types of SOD1 mutants.

2. data_screening.txt  
We previously performed an siRNA screening to identify genes that contribute to the proteostasis of mutant-like wild-type SOD1.  
This file contains information on the candidate genes that were positive in the screen.
